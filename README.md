Name your project and prepare to describe it briefly.

'Route Optimisation of an autonomous vehicle'

# Background: 
What is the problem your idea will solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

An automous vehicle is driving around a confined city area to pick up residents from their homes to bring them to a fixed number of destinations. The fixed destinations are bus stops, train station, pick up places. The residents can also travel back from the fixed locations to their homes. The autonomous vehicle covers the last mile to home and is moving continously. The AV tries to permanently optimise its route based on calls from passengers. The passengers are using an app which allows them to submit a call from their current locstion to one of the fixed locationns or from a fixed location to their home. Homelocation have to be pre registered.


# Data and AI techniques: 
What data sources does your project depend on? Almost all AI solutions depend on some data. The availability and quality of the data are essential. Which AI techniques do you think will be helpful? Depending on whether you've been doing the programming exercises or not, you may choose to include a concrete demo implemented by coding, using some actual data!

### Data
+ registered location
+ map of the area
+ calls

### AI Methodologies
+ route optimisation
+ probability
+ visualisation of passenger locations


# How is it used: 
What is the context in which your solution is used, and by whom? Who are the people affected by it? It’s important to appreciate the viewpoints of all those affected.

Residents of a fairly remote city area not well connected to the public transport system


# Challenges:

What does your project not solve? It’s important to understand that any technological solution will have its limitations.
What next: How could your project grow and become something even more?
